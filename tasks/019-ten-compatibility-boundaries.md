# Ten remaining evidence boundaries

This queue turns the remaining failures into concrete evidence contracts. Each
item must have a focused stage, an authoritative upstream fixture or app probe,
and a task-log result before it is considered improved.

1. Direct `net.Socket.connect()` must deliver a distinct server-side socket.
2. Native `net` options and lifecycle events need differential ordering checks.
3. Socket timeout liveness and `ref`/`unref` behavior need a timer trace.
4. Server keep-alive options must reach accepted native/in-memory handles.
5. Raw HTTP parsing over `net` needs request-line/header/body framing.
6. HTTP multi-request sequencing needs response/close ordering evidence.
7. Dgram remaining multi-socket and cluster fixtures need handle identity traces.
8. The full `fs.access()` fixture needs callback-count and credential sequencing.
9. ESLint needs a minimal trace of the RegExp flags/String.replace recursion.
10. Streams need a `common.mustCall` demand-scheduling trace for callbacks.

## Working rule

Do not claim a broad compatibility fix from a narrow probe. For each item,
record the failing upstream fixture, the reduced reproduction, the retained
general behavior, and the remaining difference. Push each verified item as its
own commit.

## Status

- Item 1: improved. Stage 2333 verifies explicit `Socket.connect()` server
  delivery; upstream `test-net-socket-tos.js` passes. The local-address
  reconnect fixture still has a separate close/callback mismatch.
- Item 2: partially improved. Stage 2334 verifies `connecting` true before
  the connect turn and false during the connect event; remote-address fixture
  lifecycle callbacks remain unresolved.
- Items 3–10: queued.
