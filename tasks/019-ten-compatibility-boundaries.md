# Ten remaining evidence boundaries

This queue turns the remaining failures into concrete evidence contracts. Each
item must have a focused stage, an authoritative upstream fixture or app probe,
and a task-log result before it is considered improved.

1. Direct `net.Socket.connect()` must deliver a distinct server-side socket.
2. Native `net` options and lifecycle events need differential ordering checks.
3. Socket timeout liveness and `ref`/`unref` behavior need a timer trace.
4. Server keep-alive options must reach accepted native/in-memory handles.
5. Raw HTTP parsing over `net` needs request-line/header/body framing.
6. HTTP multi-request sequencing needs response/close ordering evidence.
7. Dgram remaining multi-socket and cluster fixtures need handle identity traces.
8. The full `fs.access()` fixture needs callback-count and credential sequencing.
9. ESLint needs a minimal trace of the RegExp flags/String.replace recursion.
10. Streams need a `common.mustCall` demand-scheduling trace for callbacks.

## Working rule

Do not claim a broad compatibility fix from a narrow probe. For each item,
record the failing upstream fixture, the reduced reproduction, the retained
general behavior, and the remaining difference. Push each verified item as its
own commit.

## Status

- Item 1: improved. Stage 2333 verifies explicit `Socket.connect()` server
  delivery; upstream `test-net-socket-tos.js` passes. The local-address
  reconnect fixture still has a separate close/callback mismatch.
- Item 2: partially improved. Stage 2334 verifies `connecting` true before
  the connect turn and false during the connect event; remote-address fixture
  lifecycle callbacks remain unresolved.
- Item 3: improved. Stage 2335 and upstream
  `test-net-socket-timeout-unref.js` pass with socket `ref`, `unref`, and
  `hasRef` state.
- Item 4: partially improved. Stages 2336–2337 apply connection and server
  `keepAlive`/`keepAliveInitialDelay` options to socket handles; the larger
  client/server keep-alive fixtures still have callback/lifecycle gaps.
- Item 5: partially improved. Stage 2338 verifies terminal write errors after
  a non-half-open peer EOF; raw HTTP framing over native `net` remains queued.
- Item 6: partially improved. Stage 2339 verifies two concurrent HTTP requests
  with independent response bodies and clean shutdown; upstream multi-request
  failures remain specific to harness/agent interactions.
- Item 7: partially improved. Stage 2340 verifies default-address bind,
  implicit sender bind, packet delivery, remote metadata, and close callback
  ordering. Stage 2341 generalizes multicast-interface rejection to the full
  IPv4 multicast range while preserving `0.0.0.0` as the default-interface
  selection. The remaining exclusive implicit-bind fixture still depends on
  unsupported cluster worker behavior; the IPv6 multicast cases need a
  platform-backed validation seam.
- Item 8: partially improved. Existing stages 2309 and 2311 verify synchronous
  and callback/promise permission errors, including single-callback ordering.
  The authoritative fixture cannot currently provide stronger evidence in this
  harness because its root-user guard and `process.setuid('nobody')` branch
  terminate with an opaque QuickJS exception; credential-switch behavior must
  be fixed before claiming the full fixture.
- Item 9: partially improved. Stage 2342 covers `node:` builtin normalization
  through the central dispatcher. Replacing loader-time regex stripping with
  `startsWith()`/`slice()` removes the previous native
  `RegExp.prototype.flags`/`Symbol.replace` recursion while loading ESLint.
  ESLint now advances to a separate package-resolution failure for
  `prelude-ls`, so the full application gate remains unresolved.
- Item 10: queued.
