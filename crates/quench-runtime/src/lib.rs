//! Quench's runtime starts here and stays deliberately small.
//!
//! OXC owns syntax, scopes, and symbols. The runtime will consume queried
//! facts and execute only residual operations produced by the reducer.
//!
//! The frozen direction is:
//!
//! `source -> OXC -> ProgramDb facts -> partial evaluator -> residual Ops -> VM`
//!
//! The first implementation should establish the semantic kernel and the
//! compact representations (`Value`, `HeapRef`, `Shape`, `Frame`, `Code`,
//! `Fact`, and `Continuation`) before adding breadth.
